"""
This type defines a state that a personnel member in the simulation can have. A
state in this instance is a collection of attributes and values that must be
satisfied before a personnel member is considered to be in that state.

The type contains the following fields:
* `name::String`: the name of the state.
* `requirements::Dict{String, Vector{String}}`: the attributes (key) and the
  value(s) these attributes must have (value) for the personnel member to have
  this particular state.
* `isInitial::Bool`: this flag states whether the state is an initial state or
  not.
* `stateTarget::Int`: the target number of personnel members in this state.
* `attrScheme::Attrition`: The attrition scheme attached to this state.
* `inStateSince::Dict{String, Float64}`: a record of all the persons in the
  state, including the time they last entered the state.
